irc-thing
=========

irc bot intended for doing dumb things (but maybe you can use it for good)
It comes with 'modules' to do these dumb things. (but maybe you can add your own)

To start:

1. Add IRC info to ircbot.py
2. `. venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.pip`
4. `python ircbot.py`
5. (optional) if using image uploading, add imgur client id to imgup.py or place one in ~/.imgur_client_id
